- Added a trench to mid
// Felt like players should be encouraged to play on the point, previously there was no reason to play directly on the point
- Adjusted cover on point
// This is mostly asthetic, but I really liked these barrel cover things from Coalplant so I stole them because fuck that map :)
- Adjusted flank
// This is kinda like synthetic and cascade mixed, should be nicer to play now
- Added another ramp to climb to cat from yard
// This should add more dynamics to yard and make it nicer to play cat
- Removed the box to climb onto batts
// Too easy to get such a good defensive position
- Added cover to batts
// Snipers peaking from here cannot see ramp + angles should be cleaner
- Fixed roof collisions
- Adjusted some detailing (windows + logos)
- Fixed HDR
