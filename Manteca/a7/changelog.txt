- Reverted theme changes
// I didn't like them. Oh well. Some textures stayed tho, and the trims are nice to have
- Adjusted Cap Time
//14 -> 12. Should lead to nicer engagements on point.
- Fixed skybox issue around ramp
- Clipping adjustments
- Widened some doorframes
- Raised towers on mid
// People thought they could be up there. Raised them to make it more obvious.
- Made the box in street smaller
//Still blocks the sightline, but makes navigation much nicer
- Fixed some missing pickup patches
