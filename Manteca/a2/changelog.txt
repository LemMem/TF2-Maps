Manteca a2 Changelog

People really liked this map, which I'm very pleased about! Hopefully if this version goes well I can get some Highlander testing. 

Spawn
- Removed Right Spawn Entrance 
// Declared Useless by many people
- Added new Left Entrance w/ Highground
// This should eliviate some of the spawn camping problems seen in the first playtest
- Added cover to higher entrance
// The new spawn gate opened a pretty nasty sightline from batts to the spawn door. This change should make it so you can at the very least exit spawn.

Mid
- Gave some more space behind point and in bottom left
// People claimed that there wasn't enough space there, so I've extended the brushes here
- Reworked the entrances in cellar
// This area was very tight before. I don't see an instance of this flank without the double flank, however.
- Added health and ammo to cellar
// I want people to use this route more, so I added some more resources here to make it so you don't have to back out as far. We'll see how it plays.
