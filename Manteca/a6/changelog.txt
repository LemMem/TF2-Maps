- Removed Dropdown
// Was more annoying than anything
- Adjusted Ramp from Tower to Main
// This area should be easier to navigate AND less sniper prone. A win-win if I've ever seen one.
- Ever so slightly adjusted geometry on the sign.
- Fixed Up Jump Pad
// Unfortunatley, this stupid Jump Pad is necessary for the map to work properly.
- Added a Bunch More Signs
- Added proper Cubemaps
- Texture Changes
