- Reverted Changes on House
- func_detailed some parts of house that REALLY should've been
- Removed a window on House
// Felt like I should've given snipers a bone
- Extended Ramp
// Mostly accomidates for the Cellar changes, but also just makes it nicer to stand here
- Lit under Ramp
- Widened up Cellar
- Cellar exit now spits you out on ramp
// These 2 changes should make cellar a much nicer position to be in. I wish I could raise the ceiling, but Batts being right above won't let me do that
- Adjusted position of tower
// Sightlines, Makes that area feel less tight
- Added a little sightline block off cellar's tower
- Added a dropdown from Batts to Lobby
// Felt the rotate was to long. Still kinda slow and is only 1 way because you need to crouch.
- Various Clipping Changes
