# TF2-Maps
I make tf2 maps. I host them on this lovely platform for others to see, and make modifications. You can do whatever you like with my maps except for one thing.

### YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE AN ALPINE ARTPASS OF ANY OF MY MAPS

It's strange and oddly specific, but if you do I will find you and I will politley ask you to take it down. Other than that, do whatever you want. I don't really care.
