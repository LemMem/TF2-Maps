# TF2-Maps
I make tf2 maps. I host them on this lovely platform for others to see, and make modifications. You can do whatever you like with my maps except for one thing.

### YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE AN ALPINE ARTPASS OF ANY OF MY MAPS

It's strange and oddly specific, but if you do I will find you and I will politley ask you to take it down. Other than that, do whatever you want. I don't really care.

| Map Name         | Latest Version | Short Description                                                                                                                                                 |

| [Cleaner](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/cleaner.11079/)          | a1             | Just a map to get me back into practice of making layouts, because at this point I had made ~13 versions of Labor and worked on no other maps. Actually kinda ok. |
| Flagrate         | _Unreleased_   | I just really like this name                                                                                                                                      |
| Fright           | _Unreleased_   | Event version of Freight, based on an inside joke. I've gotta finish recreating all of Freight's brushwork one day...                                             |
| [Frostville](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/frostville.12527/)       | a4a            | Absolute BANGER payload Map. Iceetee approved.                                                                                                                    |
| Harbor           | b2             | Mannpower KOTH Map. Kinda blows. Sniper sightlines galore. b3 never released.                                                                                     |

| [Labor](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/labor.10616/)            | a17            | A questionable little KOTH map. I was never able to get the highground to be balanced, It was always too strong/weak.                                             |

| [Manteca](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/manteca.12055/)          | a4             | My best KOTH map yet. Heavily inspired by Coldfront, Glassworks, and Ashville.                                                                                    |
| [Minecraft Jungle](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/not-minecraft-jungle.11283/) | a4             | The worst 5cp you've ever played.                                                                                                                                 |
| Server           | _Unreleased_   | Unreleased Symmetrical 3cp map. Probably isn't too shit but I don't care enough to develop it further...                                                          |
| [Silent](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/silent.11636/)           | a8a            | My baby; probably my favorite map I've ever made. Def. needs more development.                                                                                    |
| Slushville       | x1             | Shitty artpass of Ashville a1                                                                                                                                     |

| Unravel          | _Unreleased_   | I can't figure out ADCTF logic. Layout is (in theory) finished, but the map kinda sucks dick.                                                                     |
| [Yellow](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/yellow.11086/)           | a1             | I take it back; THIS is the worst 5cp map ever.                                                                                                                   |
