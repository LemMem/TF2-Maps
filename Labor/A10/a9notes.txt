What players think:

- Left route useless (agreed)
- Roof to strong
- Health on mid makes defence to strong (agreed)
- Banana cramped (agreed)
- Not enough health

What I think:

 - Health and ammo need to be more obvious (probably will be fixed when left is more prevalent)
 - Roof to strong and not interesting (if it was strong but lead to interesting gameplay, then I would be ok with it)
 
General gameplay stuff I should fix:

- Displacements are fucky
