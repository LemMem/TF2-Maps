- Removed a bunch of stupid prop jumps
	- Only 1 exists, onto the train
	- Some of the fixes feel a little strange, might rework some areas
- Redid detailing at spawn (new roofs)
- Added more cover on point
- ROOF IS GONE

Something about this version feels a little off to me... besides the new details.
