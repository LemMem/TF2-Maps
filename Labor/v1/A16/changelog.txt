Gameplay
- Removed Dropdown
// It was finicky, and simply not fun
- Added connector from concrete to main
// This is another entrance to mid and connects concrete and big door
- Patched up entrance from Bungalo to concrete
// Sightlines here were ass, so i decided it would be better if you could just see it.
- Added battlements in bungalo facing the point
// Bungalo was useless, so this entrance should make it viable. IDK though, im thinking of redoing that route. Again.
