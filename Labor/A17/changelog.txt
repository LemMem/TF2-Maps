Gameplay
- Reworked Concrete
// Concrete was a little generic and I felt I could do much more with the area, so I've reworked it. This change is also so I can make space for the new flank route.

- Reworked Batts
// Battlements was by far the strangest part of the map. The sightlines felt strange and it didn't come out the way I wanted to.
//I've reworked Batts to have:
1. More flanking opprotunities, for both sides
2. Better sightlines, so snipers have more options
3. A more open sky so it's a more viable retreat route for soldiers
// Small health has been moved to lower batts (sewer?) so you have to give up height to get the high ground.

- Changed capture area and capture time
// These felt very uncomftorable in the previous version, so I believe that by doing this the point should feel much better

- Changed cover on point
// This is another playability thing, as the sidelanes on the point were very uncomftorable. Now it should feel much better to play.
