First
//Light Rework, still recognizable but a lot of new geometry
- Extended out crate
// A lot more space here, a lot nicer to stand here. "Passive Hold."
- Added a building to the empty space
// "Aggressive Hold." Goal was to make it very isolated and hard to back out. I fear it might be pretty hard to break, so it might need some adjusting
- Added a fence and adjusted crates on concrete
// This is to account for new holds and boiler rework. Speaking of which;
- Removed boiler
- Took a chunk out of the wood fence and added a ramp
// This makes it a lot more accsessible. I might adjust it later

Second
- Adjusted Forward Spawn
// New exit to make pushing out a lil easier. Definitley needs some work.
- Adjusted Far Side 
// Red spawn, Height for passive hold, Remade route to upper
- Pushed back the point
// Blu had some trouble pushing this point, as they had to push it pretty far into red territory. Once Blu takes Upper, I think Red should lose the point.
- Added new walkway above cart path
// This is to avoid the sightline down main, so it's safer to play around that bend.

Third
- Complete Remake
// Third simply wasn't good. The new third is inspired by Vigil 3rd and Eruption 2nd.
// Not sure how I ended up with 3 lobbies but hey; If it works.

Last
- Complete Remake Also
// I liked the 1st last more than what I came up with for the past 2 versions. This last definitley needs some iteration, however I think this will work much nicer than the previous last.
// The initial courtyard is not meant to be held, however I could definitley see a feesible hold in a pub. It is yet to be seen if it is too strong. I feel it might be a little to similar to the other courtyard, so a house may be in order.
// The lobby is inspired by Swiftwater, with the oneway and the walkway to rotate between the 2 sides.
// The flank and main hold area is very inspired by Vigil last. It might not show, but the isolated flank area with a route to avoid the sightline and a route that actually has the sightline, and the flank spitting you out in 2 places. Very similar to big door/IT area on vigil.

General Fixes/Changes
- Adjusted Skybox all over the map, FPS should be higher (even though it was never an issue to my knowledge)
- Adjusted Respawn Timers
- Fixed issue where you could back spawn by holding up against a forward spawn door
- Added a bunch of signs around the map
