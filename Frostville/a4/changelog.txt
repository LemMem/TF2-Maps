First
//Light Rework, still recognizable but a lot of new geometry
- Extended out crate
// A lot more space here, a lot nicer to stand here. "Passive Hold."
- Added a building to the empty space
// "Aggressive Hold." Goal was to make it very isolated and hard to back out. I fear it might be pretty hard to break, so it might need some adjusting
- Added a fence and adjusted crates on concrete
// This is to account for new holds and boiler rework. Speaking of which;
- Removed boiler
- Took a chunk out of the wood fence and added a ramp
// This makes it a lot more accsessible. I might adjust it later
