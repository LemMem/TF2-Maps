First
- Reduced space in the first courtyard
// I thought this was to flat and boring, so bringing all the setpieces together makes it more interesting imo
- Widened doorways to Warehouse
- Widened ramp
// These changes are to make standing on cart less of a deathtrap
- Moved Resup Lockers in Spawn
- Closed up window
// Was barely used and was kind of cheesy

Second
- Closed up window again
// I just cannot decide if I want this window open or not.
- Adjusted RED's visibility to catwalk.
// I really liked this visual and thought it helped BLU a lot but it ended up helping RED more.

Third
- Closed a window
// I could not get this window to work for the life of me. it had to go.

Last
- Made the far flank a one way
// This makes this route more interesting, you can completely bypass the enemy team, BUT you are stuck in a corner and easy to clean up. I hate having more than one oneway so I'm either reworking fourth's oneway OR reworking IT on last.
Miscellaneous
- Fixed some missing patches
- Fixed a missing resupply closet
- Fixed some texture issues
- Adjusted Shadows
