Second
- Adjusted Structures in Courtyard
// Felt off to me. It should feel nicer this version

Third
- Reworked Upper
// Made it similar to granary. The goal for pushing third was to require teams to clear upper and to spam down onto the point/lowground. It could use some more work, but this should be nicer.
