First
//First played ok IMO but definitley needs some changes
- Moved the point back to the door by the building
// Should make snipers playing all the way on second less powerful
- Made lobby and flank into one building
// The main goal was to remove the space from that dead end in the back of first
- Soldiers can no longer rocket jump over fence
// Rarely used, you can still spam over as demo.
- Adjusted the Back of Valley (Adjusted buildings, added crate)
// The goal here was to make sniper less powerful. Major changes to the brushwork here made the area lay out wierdly

Second
- Moved the point to after the curve
// Second was maybe a little to much harder for defenders. I feel that this isn't because their hold is to weak, but rather the point is much too close to the exit of under.
- Brought back the sniper window in lobby
// No harm in bringing it back, plus it gives an extra spam angle/sightline for attackers
- Added some props to lobby
// Lobby felt kind of empty to me, so this should make it feel more alive

Third
- Removed rocks and made a house instead
- Adjusted ramp to be less sightliney
// Some playablity adjustments to this courtyard. Should be more fun to play in and makes it so the new tunnel isn't broken for red.
- Adjusted upper and added a ramp for red to get up there
// I feel upper can be balanced by just allowing red to be up there. Should allow them to get an actual hold (although a sentry up there could get a little annoying)
- You can no longer spam over the wall
// Major buff for defenders

Last
- Completly reworked highground for defenders
// Should be safer. Making payload lasts hard :(
- Added some crates near the cart path
// More cover for both sides
- Made cart path run closer to highground
// Better for defenders holding on the highground

Misc
- Filled up some Cracks
- Clipping Fixes (Bro Moment)
