First
//First played ok IMO but definitley needs some changes
- Moved the point back to the door by the building
// Should make snipers playing all the way on second less powerful
- Made lobby and flank into one building
// The main goal was to remove the space from that dead end in the back of first
- Soldiers can no longer rocket jump over fence
// Rarely used, you can still spam over as demo.
- Adjusted the Back of Valley (Adjusted buildings, added crate)
// The goal here was to make sniper less powerful. Major changes to the brushwork here made the area lay out wierdly

Second
- Moved the point to after the curve
// Second was maybe a little to much harder for defenders. I feel that this isn't because their hold is to weak, but rather the point is much too close to the exit of under.
- Brought back the sniper window in lobby
// No harm in bringing it back, plus it gives an extra spam angle/sightline for attackers
- Added some props to lobby
// Lobby felt kind of empty to me, so this should make it feel more alive

Third
- Removed rocks and made a house instead
- Adjusted ramp to be less sightliney
// Some playablity adjustments to this courtyard. Should be more fun to play in and makes it so the new tunnel isn't broken for red.
- Reworked upper so the cave and cart path are seperate. Significantly reduced highground.
// This is to make it more Red-Oriented. That's not all though...
- Added Ramp across from Red's Current hold to get on top of tunnel
// This should make it so holds up here are possible. There is only a small ammopack so engis are better off on the ground

Misc
- Filled up some Cracks
- Clipping Fixes (Bro Moment)
