First
- Adjusted fence and surrounding textures
//I made this look like a barracade that red put up, idk how well that will translate tho
- Made far right (from blu's perspective) entrance into a building
// The route is effectively unchanged but should make blu players using this route less visible

Second
- Widened Elbow
// Blu should be able to flood out of here

Third
- Adjusted cover on platform
// People could shoot into and out of spawn from aps, very bad. I also wanted to adjust the stairs and stuff

Misc.
- Clipping fixes
