First
- Lowered flank to remove dumb jump onto ledge
// Should be a lot safer for blue

Second
- You can no longer jump through window

Third
- Added a Snowycoast gate to entrance
// I hate these, but red would complain about not having any time to setup
- Made Red's route into side house close after 3rd is capped
// No more spawncamping

Last
- Shortened Far Side of Last
// This should reduce sightlines, along with the next change.
- Doubled up crates
// Reduces sightlines as previously mentioned, and it makes it so heavies, engis etc. can't get up here
- Lowered 2nd layer of last
// This reduces sightlines. I fear it might be to hard to hold here now, but it doesn't really matter
- Turned fences into a house
// Reduces sightlines. Also makes it harder to get spammed out from the last platform.

Misc
- Brightened Lighting
- IN THEORY fixed seam issue on first.
