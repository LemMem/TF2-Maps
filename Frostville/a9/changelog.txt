I was a little miffed that I didn't get to play frostville (something I haven't done in a while) however getting the map tested with players that likely have not played the map before was an eye opener for many things. Namely:
1. Second needs a lot of adjustment
2. The fourth choke sucks (big shocker)
I also got some conflicting feedback on the length of the map. I could definitley reduce it, just remove one of the points, but I feel this is more a consequence of how hard it is to break the second choke point.

This update contains mostly changes around 1st and second, and I'll be saving fourth changes for a later update.

First
- Enlargened + Reworked far right
// The fence and the crate were very awkward to navigate, and hopefully this house creates more dynamics around this area. More space towards the container may be necessary
- Added new corridor to far left of point
// Opens when A is capped. Leads to a balcony inside lobby. Might be a tad cramped...
- Removed door to second from hill
// Opened a shnasty sniper sightline. It led to Red having an advantage when that door opened
- Widened the far left (from blu's perspective)
// Felt kind of wierd without any "depth variation"
- Added door from pub spot to lobby
// Might be a little problematic sightline wise but imo its nice to have a transition here
- Removed health from the cubby
- Added health to the pub spot
// People wanted health here, and I didn't like the health in the old spot. Probably will make it less annoying for pub engis to setup in there.
- Brightened leftmost spawndoor's area

Second
- Added some windows to lobby
- Added a balcony for blu
// Hopefully should aid in Blu pushing into here. I feel it might need some more adjusting, Red has the highground entering onto them (although this is how Vigil works as well so it might be fine).
