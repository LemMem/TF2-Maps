Second
- Added another route into Blue's Courtyard
// Felt it was to easy to hold this on red. I want this to be "free" space for blue, so it should be relativley easy to break
- Adjusted health+ammo

Third
- COMPLETE REDESIGN
// Tried to keep the original design in some form, but reworked to be easier to actually hold and such.

Last
- COMPLETE REDESIGN
// Didn't keep elements from the old version, it was way to cramped and un-last like. IDK if it feel more like a last, but it should play better imo.

Misc
- Compiled with BSPReveal
