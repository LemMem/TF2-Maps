Third
// Third continues to be a bit of a tricky hold for red; which probably helps for pacing but I want a some form of hold for red.
- Made tunnel into a building
// Similar gameplay but makes it easier to hold and worse sightlines for blu once it does get taken
- Added a dropdown from upper to lower
// It felt natural. Red has to expose themself to use it and it's pretty convenient for blu
- Flipped the lower -> upper building
// Makes it so red can have cover once entering the building
// My main problem with this point is that red has no safe transition from their spawn to the main building

Fourth
- Fixed issue relating to oneway door's trigger

Last
// Last suffered more from feeling wierd than it's actual gameplay, so most of the changes were made to help with that
- Adjusted cover around truck
// Didn't actual protect that corner
- Adjusted box on the left side (from red's perspective)
// Also didn't properly cover that corner, this should make the sightline worse
- Removed left spawndoors ramp
// More space, and there is a spawn door right there. Didn't really do anything except created more safe sniper spots.
- Added new route from lobby to last
// IDK if this will get used, but I felt like a route should be here
- Flipped truck
// Now blu can get up here to put sentries/heavies there. Makes this corner safer for blu.
- Added rollback to ramp
// Makes clutches from red more possible. I love rollbacks like this.

Misc
- Adjusted textures throughout the map
- Added some more cubemaps that needed them
- Clipping changes
