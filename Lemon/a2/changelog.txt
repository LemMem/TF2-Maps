- Adjusted TFC Resources
// Major props to @Sonoma for making the skybox and announcer voicelines!
- Detailed Lobby
// This is most likely not going to change any time soon.
- Adjusted IT and the transition from Sewer to IT
// This is now its own self-contained system, away from the new sewer. This should feel nicer on offence and should be relativley the same on offence
- Fixed some clipping issues
- Fixed some texturing issues
