These are all of my questionable old maps. I wanted to remove them off the workshop but keep them just in case, so here is where you can find them.

E - My second KOTH map that blows still
Bitchmode - My only succsessful payload map. Succsessful as in I got it to compile.
Basalt - A CTF map that would be ok if sniper wasn't in the game.
