Silent a5
After getting some competitive testing (finally), I've made various changes in the layout that makes me more confident on it's viability. Let's tackle the most important change first.

Last
- Shortened Defender Respawn Time and Increased Attacker Respawn Time.
// If you wiped on second, then by the time you respawn on last the point will already be halfway capped. That was a major problem for me, so defenders on last have more of a chance to set up.

Mid -> Second Connectors
- Added pillar to death hallway
// Finally came up with a call for this route. People got shredded in this route, so calling it death hallway seems accurate. The pillar should make playing here more interesting

Mid
- Removed cover on top of point
// People just caught on this, and it didn't serve any real purpose so I got rid of it
- Added Cover to Lower
// This route was just used after mids for cleanup, so this should make it a more valuable route.
- Widened Doors from Banana
// Makes this route nicer to push out of.
