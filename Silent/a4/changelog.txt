Silent a4 Patch Notes
2 Changes I feel will make the map play better.

Mid
- Raised displacements under mid to be higher
//Thank you to @armio43 for the feedback!
- Adjusted rock to be a concrete ramp
// Rock didn't make much sense to be the way it was, so I changed it to the ramp.

Mid -> Second
- Changed valley to be shorter and indoors
// Valley felt a little underpowered, so I changed it's geometry and length so it'll have more utility. Of course, because of this there are now only 3 entrances on mid, so I may make an adjustment.
