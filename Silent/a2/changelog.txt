Gameplay

Mid

Second

- Complete rework
// I like metalworks second, but my second didn't really have the qualities I liked about it and I like the spire a lot more. Needs some more polish, i'm just not sure where
- Made (what was) shutter into the main choke and turned valley into a flank
//Just kinda made sense. I'm not sure about the balancing on Valley tho, might need to make it better when coming from mid
- Moved forward spawn to the other side of the point
//This was born out of nesscesity, as I couldn't keep the forward spawn on the other side without putting it in the flank. See Badlands on why that is a bad idea.

Last

- Changed displacements for improved navigation
- Made defenders on left have height disad
// Should make it easier for attackers to push. Not quite sure tho
- Complete rework of house
//
