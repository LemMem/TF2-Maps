Silent a7
First "real" changes I've made from competitive testing. 2 Pretty major changes affecting the midfight and last.

Mid -> Second
- Added new connector from Death Hallway to mid that significantly quickens the rollout
// Callout for this route is "Rollout"; I fear teams will only enter Death Hallway through Rollout now, so in future versions ramp room may need some adjustments to make it more viable

Second
- Made the Box on Metal into a Pipe
// It was a pipe in earlier versions, but it didn't make much sense. I added a fan to toxic so now it's logical.

Last
- Adjusted rock model
- Added a platform by rock
// Some nicer positioning on this side for defence and offence alike. Should make last more interesting.
