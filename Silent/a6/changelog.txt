Silent a6
I'm very happy with how the competitive testing went this time. Even though it was a clean sweep, the game was intense. I feel I succeeded in making a fun layout if I want to play the map (which hopefully I will)
Also, next time send the demo to me. This version would be out much quicker if I actually got it.

Mid
- Added point barriers so getting on point is more difficult from right
//The right-side rollout was significantly more powerful than the left side one, so I'm trying to make the left rollout more viable.

Second
