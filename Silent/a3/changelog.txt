Silent a3 Patch Notes
Just some polish changes so that competitive tests aren't questionable. I also made a change to last because the point was, kindly put, ass. The house is a lot cooler and I like it more.I might put this on tftv soon, so keep a look out!

Mid
- Clipping Changes
	
Mid->Second
- Choke is now brighter

Second
- Grates on Second no longer have splash go through them

Lobby
- Made the door larger from lobby to concrete

Last
- Clipping Changes
- Added new building to replace the spire
// The spire was more annoying than anything, so this building should result in more interesting gameplay
- Fixed visibility bug that let people see into spawn
