Layout
- Completely reworked mid
// People really liked to complain about sightlines, and that was mostly because of mid. 
// Mid has been tightened up with a bunch of rocks, a nipple, and 2 big ol' fashioned houses. I'm afraid these will clash with the connector and end up being doorway soup, so i may seal it up.
-Added rock to valley
//Once again, more sightline problems. I feel the sightlines at choke aren't too bad but i may end up plugging some of them up
- Changed around middle lobby for different angles
// Snipers. Fuck em, amiright?

Detailing
- Made point visual for 2nd go ontop of the spire instead of below.
// Someone said the points didn't feel "important" enough. I don't know what that means, but hopefully moving this ontop will make second play better
- Changed Skybox and Lighting
// The new skybox really hurt visibility last time, so I changed it to the the gravelpit skybox. I might just end up going back to the old overcast sky, but I really don't want to. I don't want to be known as the guy who makes overcast maps.
- Brightened up Lower Lobby
// idk why i thought it was good in a3

Overall, I'm happy with last. So far it's played the best of the map. Or at least, it's shown the least amount of problems. 
Second "works," although I might redo it to make something like Process second, as my "doors" would work well with that kind of design I feel.
I like the new mid. The nipple is more gullywash and less bagel. It's there to act as cover more than as something the entire mid revolves around. I mentioned some of my gripes earlier but overall I'm pretty happy with the result.
